1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What areas are currently supported for inclusion in the Admin Bar Hopper "Hop To..." menu? =

Admin Bar Hopper currently supports listing:

* all Pages of your site, grouped into sets of 10 at a time, with support for child/parent structure
* Menus, to list all Menus that your site has, and on the next sublevel of dropdown, all the links for each Menu
* Categories, to hop to any Category of Posts

= Do the links go to Edit that area, or View the front-end? =

All the first level links ("Pages 1-10", "Menus", "Categories") go to the appropriate Pages / Menus / Categories area on the Admin side. After that, all direct links to specific Pages / Categories will take you to the front-end view (what visitors see). You can use the separate "Edit Page/Post" link in the Admin Bar to Edit that particular content.

= Do I have to show all three of those areas? =

A Settings page gives you three checkboxes to control which of these groups of links to add to the Admin Bar.

= Does Admin Bar Hopper support Custom Post Types, Custom Taxonomies, or Tags? =

Not at the this time, but future releases will add support for these other areas of WordPress.
